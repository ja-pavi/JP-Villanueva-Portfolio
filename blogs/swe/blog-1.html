      <h3>Where did you grow up?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p> 
        I grew up just north of Houston in Spring, Texas. 
      </p>

      <h3>What high school did you attend?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I attended Klein High School.
      </p>

      <h3>Why did you come to UT?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        As a Texas kid, being able to attend the best public school in the state and the largest college brand in the nation was an easy choice. With UT having a great business school, great computer science program, the value was unbeatable for in-state tuition. I got into some strong out-of-state programs, but I never wanted to leave Texas.
      </p>

      <h3>What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>My favorite highschool extracurricular activity in high school was attending local hackathons with close friends. In my senior year, we built a geo-fencing location system for elementary school parent pick up systems and got first in multiple categories of the competition. I made life long friends through this, as well as learned many skills through building ideas that interested me.</p> 

      <h3>Why are you majoring in CS?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>I'm majoring in CS because I believe that it allows me to technical software skills that can be applied to any industry. Through my degree I have been able to explore a myriad of career paths and many industries. As technology continues to evolve, I believe that a programming background is only going to get more and more important!</p>

      <h3>Why are you in this class?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>I'm in this class as I want to expand my skillset around Python, SQL, and collaborating with peers. I have heard this course be recommended by many upperclassmen as well.</p>

      <h3>What are your expectations of this class?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>My expectations surround coming out with a sufficient foundation around Python and SQL, while also understanding the collaboration that goes on within the software engineering industry.</p>
      
      <h3>How much do you know about Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>I have explored and used all 4 of these tools, however I have very little formal education in them. I taught myself how to use the basics of them through youtube videos and building out passion projects.</p>

      <h3>How did you like the first lectures?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>I was not on campus for the first lecture, however the third lecture was great. I enjoyed how Prof. Downing incorporates the class through 1-on-1 discussions with students. I was very engaged and look forward to the rest of the semester.</p>

      <h3>How did you feel about the cold calling?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>Loved it. I hope I'm ready when I'm called.</p>

      <h3>What do you think about specifications grading?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>I think that it's an interesting idea, and one that is more aligned to how we will be graded throughout our careers. I don't have too much an opinion yet, but I'm intrigued to see how it pans out.</p>

      <h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>Being able to reconnect with my roommates who I haven't been able to see since last semester.</p>

      <h3>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>My tip of the week has to be always use assertions, and when you find a bug in your code put a assertion that can catch that bug before fixing the code! Thanks to Prof. Downing I will not forget this lesson.</p>
