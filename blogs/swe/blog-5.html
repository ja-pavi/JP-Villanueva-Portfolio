      <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This past week I spent recovering from my trip to California, and I mainly did so by listening to the artist I have pictured above, McKinley Morganfield. I began listening to McKinley Morganfield because of a close friend of mine, and now put it on when I look to flee from my thoughts and present worries. After California, I found my sleep schedule and my mind both all over the place. Have been using this past week to relax a little bit.
      </p>

      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I don't think there is anything in front of me, I normally feel like this. I have a couple of opportunities in front of me that I'm still working towards, though they will fall into place with time. Currently, I am happy with the work from my team on IBD 1, and believe that we have had great communication. However, with that said, I believe that there is still room to grow as a team, and continue to build on our current communication. Though I believe that will continue to improve with time as well.
      </p>

      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This upcoming week, I look forward to finishing up Phase 1 of IBD 1 with my team. I also look forward too getting through another week of school, as I'm currently looking to downsize my current schedule and off load some of the extra activities that I'm doing around campus to make room for new activities. I'm falling into a nice groove, and hope that I can continue to keep up this strong pace.
      </p>

      <h3>What did you think of Paper #5: The Single Responsibility Principle.</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I have not yet looked at Paper #5, though will be cracking into it after this blog post. Looking forward to it. 
      </p>

      <h3>What was your experience of the coverage of Python types and operators? (This question will vary, week to week.)</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I did okay. I say okay because honestly I felt myself falling in and out of concentration on the topic, and most likely need to re-watch the lectures and notes to fully grasp the concept. I did fine of the quizzes, though I could've done better. With that said, I greatly enjoyed the topics and I'm glad that the course explores ideas at such a high and low level.
      </p>

      <h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I found someone that I really clicked with this week, and I'm glad that I got to meet them. Wish they lived closer so we could talk more, though there is quite some distance between us. 
      </p>

      <h3>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        My pick-of-the-week has to be Postman, and the ease of access that it provides for utilizing RESTful API's. Makes my life a lot easier on IBD 1.
