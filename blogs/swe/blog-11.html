      <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This past week was full of great surprises, and I've got to spend time with great people. I was able to grab coffee with a great alumni of UT, and another with a close friend I have not spoken to in some time. Both were fantastic for two different reasons, and I hope to continue getting coffee and catching up with friends weekly. 
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        My family has also come up to Austin for the weekend, and I'm getting to see them later today. Unfortunately, I was stopped at the gates of the UT Football game for having too much motion, and was not allowed to enter in concern for a meltdown from K State fans.
      </p> 
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I also got recommended a couple of books this week:
      </p>
      <p></p>
        <p>1. The Alchemy of Finance</p>
      <p></p>
        <p>2. The Price of time</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Excited to break into them these upcoming weeks. To update from my last blog, I did get a haircut.
      </p>

      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I'll reiterate a similar sentiment from last week as things haven't really changed. I believe that I don't have anything in my way. I'm feeling good about this upcoming week, and have a lot stronger focus heading into the end of this semester. Time really does fly by, feel like I just moved in to this new apartment. I'm happy, have made tons of great memories, but life is flying currently. For better or for worse, I just am so glad with where I'm at. Wish I could pause things from time to time to take it in better.
      </p>

      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This upcoming week, I'm looking to take an exam, and get some work done.
      </p>

      <h3>What did you think of Paper #11. More on getters and setters.</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This week I am finally completing the paper before doing the blog, so I have some thoughts about the paper finally. Like I normally say, I always enjoy reading the papers that are assigned to us, as most of them I find them quite interesting. Being able to annotate and bring some of my own thoughts and connections to the paper allows me to learn better, and allows me to further dive into Computer Science topics. This week, allowed me to really deep dive into a new topic, and appreciate the intricacies and vast arena that software engineering provides.
      </p>

      <h3>What did you think of of natural_join and SQL? (This question will vary, week to week.)</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I greatly enjoyed the topics that we covered this past week, and I did way better on the quizzes this week. I think I'm also done with exercises.
      </p>

      <h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Spending time with people that I have a lot of love for.
      </p>

      <h3>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        My pick-of-the-week has to be Matlab, it's pretty cool and some of my engineering friends introduced me to it.
