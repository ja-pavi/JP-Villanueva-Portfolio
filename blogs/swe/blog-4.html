      <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I'm writing this while sitting in the San Jose airport after a weekend trip to California. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF) Stem Summit in San Jose, CA as a HSF Scholar these past couple of days. I was able to meet some great people, now turned friends, as well as talk to alumni of the program as well on career opportunities and mentoring. Overall, it was a great experience, though I find myself both eager and ready to return to Austin.
      </p>

      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Currently, I don't believe there is anything in my way. Though there is a opportunity in front of me, that I'm looking forward to acting on at the beginning of this week.
      </p>

      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I'm looking forward to working on my second individual project for Game Technology, catching up on a couple of courses, and coordinating with my team on Assignment #2 for the course I am writing this blog for, CS 373.
      </p>

      <h3>What did you think of Paper #4: All I Really Need to Know about Pair Programming I Learned In Kindergarten?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        It's always fun to re-explore ideas that you have visited in the past. In this situation, I am revisiting the idea of pair programming and the skills need it to do it successfully. I was first introduced to the idea of pair programming in CS 314, Data Structures. Here, we spent time working on a couple of different projects with a partner, and had to be able manager our code base successfully as a team. I was happy to revisit the topic in the paper annotations.   
      </p>

      <h3>What was your experience of the IDB1 project, now that it's starting? (This question will vary, week to week.)</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I'm happy with the teammates I got, as everyone has been pretty easy to communicate with. Though we haven't collaborated too much yet due to a couple of us being busy over the weekend, I greatly look forward to connecting with the gang this upcoming week. Exciting stuff is going to come from this group.
      </p>

      <h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Making new friends at the Summit, I hope to see them again in the future.
      </p>

      <h3>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Pick-of-the-week has to be GDExstension, a Godot plugin, that allows for C++ script to be ran inside the Godot Mono game engine.
