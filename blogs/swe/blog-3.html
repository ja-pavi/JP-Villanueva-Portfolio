      <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>Yesterday was the Texas vs Alabama football game, and I went to our apartment's pool to watch it with my roomates. We won, which was great, excited to see what we do the rest of the year. Hook Em'. </p>

      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>Currently, I don't believe there is anything in my way. There is a couple things that I'm waiting on, though I feel pretty good about these upcoming weeks.</p>

      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>I'm headed to California at the end of the week for a STEM Summit for a scholarship program, so hopping on a plane Thursday morning in Austin, and leaving California Sunday afternoon.</p>

      <h3>What did you think of Paper #3: Continuous Integration</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>It was a great, insightful read that allowed me to dig into a new software engineering practice. I found it interesting and exciting to see how software engineering work in a team setting is executed in industry.</p>

      <h3>What did you think of the Perusall quiz?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>I might be in the minority here, but I don't think I got a Perusall quiz. I annotated the paper, though don't remember seeing a quiz. Someone let me in on the secret.</p>

      <h3>What was your experience of the Collatz project, now that it's done? (This question will vary, week to week.)</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>I really enjoyed Collatz, I found it as a good introductory project to get myself re-familiarized with Python as I haven't used it in a while. I'm excited about isPrime and hope to keep building on my skill sets throughout the duration of the course.</p>

      <h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>Watching UT beat Bama in the pool with my friends made me happy.</p>

      <h3>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>Pick-of-the-week would be Godot 4, I have been using it in my Game Technology course to build out game engines and I have found it to be a great tool.</p>
