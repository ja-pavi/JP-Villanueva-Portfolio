      <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This past week I was able to check an item off my life to do list. I was fortunate enough to attend the Formula 1 Austin Grand Prix with my dad this weekend. I got interested in Formula 1 a couple years back, and coming to UT for school heading to the Austin GP was always something my Dad and I wanted to attend. I also haven't seen my dad since I got dropped off for school in August, so it was great catching up. Great weekend, fun race to watch. 

        I also have been getting to watch the Astros vs Rangers series. Per my last predication, the Rangers are at 2 wins, and Astros can will it all tonight and head to the World Series. Hopefully the 'Stros lock it in tonight.
      </p>

      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I'll reiterate a similar sentiment from last week as things haven't really changed. I believe that I don't have anything in my way. Still working out of a rut, though taking it day by day. Excited about this upcoming week and a couple of the opportunities that I'm able to take part in.
      </p>

      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This upcoming week, we start cooking on IBD #3, so I will prioritize getting that ready for that. I also wil be watching the Rangers and Astros series finish, and get some assignments finished up for other classes as well. All in all, should be a solid week and I'm greatly looking forward to it.
      </p>

      <h3>What did you think of Paper #9. The Dependency Inversion Principle.</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This week I am completing the blog before doing the paper, so I don't have feeling towards the paper yet. Though with that said, I always enjoy reading the papers that are assigned to us, as most of them I find them quite interesting. Being able to annotate and bring some of my own thoughts and connections to the paper allows me to learn better, and allows me to further dive into Computer Science topics.
      </p>

      <h3>What did you think of of Project #3: IDB2? (This question will vary, week to week.)</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I greatly enjoyed the topics that we covered this past week, and I did a little better than the previous week.
      </p>

      <h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Spending time with people that I have a lot of love for.
      </p>

      <h3>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        My pick-of-the-week has to be the COTA app. I use it for all my note taking and writings on my iPad. Great tool.
