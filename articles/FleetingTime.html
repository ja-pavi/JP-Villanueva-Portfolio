      <h1><a class="title-highlight" href="#the-cosmos-1">Thoughts on <em>fleeting</em> time</a></h1>
      <h2>Jacob Villanueva</h2>

      <time datetime="03-09-2014">JUN. 29, 2022</time>
      <p>
        I often
        <em>
          <a class="text-highlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronophobia">fear that I'm running out of time</a>. 
        </em>
        That one day I'll wake up and realize my dreams have long passed me. I worry frequently about time,
        more so than I even take action against these fears. I worry so much on the things that I can't control, that I forget to make use of the things that I can control.
        </p>

        
        <p>
          <h3>
            <em>
              I think I am a glass half empty guy.
            </em>
          </h3>
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3>
            <em> 
              Though I'm slowly swaying to the other team.
            </em>
          </h3>
        </p>
        
       
        <p>
        You could give me 24 hours, and I would stress for 23 of those hours that I don't have enough time, instead of using those hours to complete the given work.
        Maybe a time management problem or maybe just stuck in my own mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think too much, just need to do.
        </p>

        <p>
        Though a majority of these issues stem from healthy places. Places inside of me that wish to accomplish hundreds of things in my life.
        Passions that fill time slots not readily available. How does one live a full life if not for a heart filled with thousands of interests and desires?
        </p>

        <p>
        I often contemplate if its healthier for me to have hundreds of passions and interests, or rather cut it down to the few I care most about.
        I'm often finding myself switching my current interests for the next exciting thing that lands in front of me. Though leading to interesting new avenues,
        the ability to stay consistent on interests builds a stronger foundation in both self-discipline and that area of learning. 
        </p>

        <p>
        It's hard to imagine this, but if time was never ending what would be the point? Time gives life value, makes the moments where your happiest meaningful,
        and your own suffering not without reason.
        </p>

        <p>
        Though just a jumbled concoction of my thoughts, I write this entry because time is fleeting. Because one day I will be gone. I leave these thoughts as a time capsule 
        of a person becomes a part of the past as quickly as I move into the future. I hope one day to remember the person I was when I write these pieces. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This article is not up to par with how I wish to view my writing. Though I often delete many of my works which I do not enjoy, and I have thought of that as a pretty poor practice.
        So I will leave this to stay, my first piece online. 
        </p>
