      <h3>Over-Simplification of Bond Basis</h3>
      <p class="has-dropcap"> 
        The bond basis is the difference between the spot price of a bond and the futures price of the bond. 
        Though since all bond's are not the same, we must adjust the bond basis to account for the differing coupon rates, and time to maturity. This is done by dividing the bond basis by the conversion factor of the bond.
        When the yield curve is positively sloped, holding a bond position for future delivery produces a net income. Also, bonds "throw off a yield" with a coupon income. For these reasons, the bond basis is typically positive, meaning that the spot price of the bond is higher than the futures price.
      </p>
      <h3>Options Explanation</h3>
      <p>
        To put it simply, an options contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller in a market that allows the buyer the right to purchase (or sell) an asset within a given timeframe at an agreed upon price. Due to the favorable nature given to the buyer to either exercise or not exercise the agreement, the buyer of the option pays a premium upfront to the seller. 
      </p>
      <h3>Garman Kohlhagen</h3>
      <p>
        An interesting problem that surrounds options is how to correctly price them to not allow investors to arbitrage* inefficiencies. As stated in the introduction there are multiple models that have been developed over time that have become the standard, most known being the Black Scholes model. The Black Scholes model is used predominantly for stock options, and needs a few adjustments to make it viable for FX options. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where Garman Kohlhagen’s model looks to fill the gaps by taking into account the differing interest rates that exist in the countries of the currency pairs given in an FX option. Utilizing a similar composition to Black Scholes, we calculate the price of an option through the underlying spot price, risk free rate (both domestically and foreign), time to maturity, and volatility. I have taken the equations that Garman Kohlhagen has done, and put them into Python.
      </p>
      <p><i>* Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same or similar asset in different markets in order to profit from tiny differences in the asset's listed price (Investopedia, How Arbitraging Works in Investing).</i></p>

</pre>
<p>2) As a start, I looked to pull historical data on the Euro to USD exchange rate (EUR/USD). (KEEP FIXING FROM HERE) Starting by hard coding in both the expiration date and strike price of the FX option contract I looked to calculate. Though for the spot rate and interest rates, I utilized the Pandas DataReader library to pull live data from the Federal Reserve API. It was here, I was able to pull both the exchange rate of EUR/USD, as well as the U.S. risk free rate (US1Y), and the Euro short-term rate (€STR).</p>
<p>Most of the code snippet below, is me manipuling the Pandas dataframe in order to get today closing price, previous day closing price, and then the daily returns of the spot rate. Then I calculate the expiry date.</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-python"># DEXUSEU is U.S. Dollars to Euro Spot Exchange Rate
expiry = '02-23-2024'
strike = 1.1170

# Pulling FX Exchange data from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
exchange_rate = reader.DataReader('DEXUSEU', 'fred')

# Renaming Column, and dropping NA rows
exchange_rate = exchange_rate.dropna()

# Calculating, Adding Previous Closing Price Column & Daily Returns
exchange_rate = exchange_rate.assign(Previous = exchange_rate.DEXUSEU.shift(1))
exchange_rate['Returns'] = ((exchange_rate.DEXUSEU - exchange_rate.Previous) / exchange_rate.Previous)

# Renaming column to EUR/USD
exchange_rate.rename(columns={'DEXUSEU': 'EUR/USD'}, inplace=True)

# Calculating Volatility from historical data
sigma = np.sqrt(252) * exchange_rate['Returns'].std() 

# Pulling One Yr. Yield data from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
oneyrUSD = (reader.DataReader('DGS1', 'fred').iloc[-1] / 100)[0]
oneyrEUR = (reader.DataReader('ECBESTRVOLWGTTRMDMNRT', 'fred').iloc[-1] / 100)[0]

# Spot Price
spot = exchange_rate['EUR/USD'].iloc[-1]

# Calculating Time to Maturity
T = (datetime.strptime(expiry, "%m-%d-%Y") - datetime.utcnow()).days / 365

exchange_rate</code>
</pre>
<p>3) Utilizing all the above functions, I can now calculate the modeled price of the EUR/USD option with the following parameters:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-python"># Variables for Pricing
print("Spot Price:      ", round(spot, 3))
print("Strike Price:    ", round(strike, 3))
print("1 Yr US Yield %: ", round(oneyrUSD, 3))

print("Sigma:           ", round(sigma, 3))

# Storing Option Price for use in calcualting Implied Volatility

# Print Option Price

<h3>
Calculating Implied Volatility using Garman Kohlhagen pricing model
</h3>
<p>
"The term implied volatility refers to a metric that captures the market's view of the likelihood of future changes in a given security's price. Implied volatility isn't the same as historical volatility, which measures past market changes and their actual results" (Investopedia, How Implied Volatility (IV) Works).
</p>
<p>
One way to calculate implied volatility is to plug in all the other variables into the GK function, and back solve for volatility itself. In the below snippet, I'm creating a lambda function that uses trial and error based on an initial guess to find the minimum difference in the given GK price with the initial sigma value and the calculated GK option price with a historical sigma.
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-python">def implied_volatility(option_price, S, K, T, rd, rf, initial_guess = 0.2, flag = "c"):
# Calculating Implied Volatility using both the GK model and numerical optimization from the Scipy minimize function
implied_volatility_function = lambda sigma : np.sum((garman_kohlhagen(S, K, T, rd, rf, sigma, flag) - option_price) ** 2)

# Numerical Optimization to find the sigma value with the least squared difference to the GK Pricing Model
optimal_difference = minimize(implied_volatility_function, initial_guess, bounds=[(0,1)])

return optimal_difference.x[0]</code>
</pre>
<p>Calling the function, and showcasing difference: </p>
<pre>
<code class="language-python"># Implied Volatility of Option
IV = implied_volatility(option_call_price, spot, strike, T, oneyrUSD, oneyrEUR)

# Printing out Implied Volatility, Historical Volatility
print("Implied Volatility:      ", IV)
print("Historical Volatility:   ", sigma)</code>
</pre>
<pre>
<code class="language-python">
    # Output
    Implied Volatility:       0.07259883228509564
    Historical Volatility:    0.07259807632223692
</code>
</pre>
<h3>Volatility Smile Construction Functions</h3>
<p>The volatility smile is a graphical pattern that shows that implied volatility for the options in question increases as they move away from the current stock or asset price (Sofi, What Is A Volatility Smile?).</p>
<p>Here in this function, we are taking in a list of GK modeled option prices at varying maturities and expirations, a separate list of strikes and maturities, the two differing interest rates, and the given spot price. With these variables, we are able to take every option price calculated, with their respective strike and maturity, and calculate the implied volatility of the given option. Then we append this implied volatility strike and maturity to a implied volatilities list that will be used for plotting.</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-python"># Constructing the volatility smile from the strikes and maturities lists given
def volatility_smile(option_prices, S, Ks, Ts, rd, rf):
    implied_volatilities = []
    
    # Loop through the maturities
    for T in Ts:
        # Loop through the strike prices
        for K in Ks:
            # Pull the option price by using the maturity and strike price as a key
            option_price = option_prices[(K, T)]

            # Calculate the implied_volatility from the given parameters
            IV = implied_volatility(option_price, S, K, T, rd, rf)
            implied_volatilities.append((K, T, IV))

    return implied_volatilities</code>
</pre>
<p>Here, we now plot said implied volatilities that we calculated in the previous function to showcase a volatility smile. Here I unpack the tuple passed in, to separate the strikes, maturities, and IVs. I then for loop through every other maturity and plot them against each other as showcased later. Another interesting aspect is the interpolation style I used being cubic, though look to experiment with a couple other methods.</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-python">def plot_volatility_smile(implied_volatilities):
    # Unpack implied volatilities tuple
    strikes, maturities, vols = zip(*implied_volatilities)

    # Sort maturities in ascending order
    sorted_maturities = sorted(set(maturities))

    # Plot the volatility smile for each maturity
    for T in sorted_maturities[:len(sorted_maturities)//2]:
        subset = [(K, IV) for K, _, IV in implied_volatilities if _ == T]
        subset_strikes, subset_vols = zip(*subset)

        # Use cubic interpolation to smooth the volatility smile
        f = interp1d(subset_strikes, subset_vols, kind='cubic')
        smooth_strikes = np.linspace(min(subset_strikes), max(subset_strikes), 100)
        smooth_vols = f(smooth_strikes)

        plt.plot(smooth_strikes, smooth_vols, label=f'Maturity: {round(T * 365)} days')

    plt.xlim(left=min(strikes) - .005, right=max(strikes) + .005)
    plt.ylim(bottom=min(vols) - 0.005, top=max(vols) + 0.005)
    plt.xlabel('Strike Price')
    plt.ylabel('Implied Volatility')
    plt.title('Volatility Smile')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()</code>
</pre>
<h3>Plotting the Volatility Surface with Matplotlib</h3>
<p>"The volatility surface refers to a three-dimensional plot of the implied volatilities of the various options listed on the same stock. Implied volatility is used in options pricing to show the expected volatility of the option's underlying stock over the life of the option" (Investopedia, Volatility Surface Explained).</p>
<p>Similar to how we plotted the volatility smile, we now plot the volatility surface across all maturities and strikes. In order to do this, we now plot in 3D over 2D. To start, I similarly unpack the tuple, and create a volatilities 2D array in order to plot it with the ax.plot_surface function. Again I use a smoothing interpolation with a cubic method.</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-python">def plot_volatility_surface(implied_volatilities):
    # Extract strikes, maturities, and implied volatilities
    strikes, maturities, vols = zip(*implied_volatilities)

    # Convert to NumPy arrays
    strikes_array = np.array(list(set(strikes)))
    maturities_array = np.array(list(set(maturities)))
    vols_array = np.array(vols)

    # Reshape vols_array into a 2D array
    vols_matrix = vols_array.reshape(len(strikes_array), len(maturities_array))

    # Smooth the volatility surface using 2D interpolation
    smooth_maturities, smooth_strikes = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(min(maturities_array), max(maturities_array), 25),
                                                    np.linspace(min(strikes_array), max(strikes_array), 25))
    smooth_vols = griddata((maturities, strikes), vols, (smooth_maturities, smooth_strikes), method='cubic')

    # Plot the smoothed volatility surface
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    ax.plot_surface(smooth_maturities, smooth_strikes, smooth_vols, cmap='viridis')


    ax.set_xlim(0, max(maturities))  # Adjust the range as needed
    ax.set_ylim(min(strikes), max(strikes)) # Adjust the range as needed
    ax.set_zlim(min(vols) - 0.005, max(vols) + 0.005) # Adjust the range as needed
    ax.set_xlabel('Maturity (Days)')
    ax.set_ylabel('Strike Price')
    ax.set_zlabel('Implied Volatility')
    ax.set_title('Volatility Surface')

    plt.show()</code>

<h3>Collecting EUR/USD Strikes & Maturities</h3>
<p>Here I looked to hard code in the maturities for EUR/USD from CME Group's Option Chain & EUR/USD Options Chain from Investing.com. I understand that typically strikes are not set across differing maturities, though for the sake of the first implementation of the project, I kept them constant.

<h3>Creating list of all option contract possibilities</h3>
<p>In order to plot against all these maturities, we need to create a list of the possible values that an option contract can take across all strikes and maturities. That is why here, I'm looking to calculate the option prices of all contracts at all possible contract combinations. Putting them in a dictionary where each strike, maturity corresponds with the given option price of said contract. This will be useful for calculating our implied volatilities and both of our plotting functions</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'm not yet fully satisfied with this project, as I feel that there is a lot to be improved and expanded on. However, I do believe this work sets a strong foundation on utilizing the Garman Kohlhagan options pricing model in Python, and with the use of Pandas datareader could be a viable way of modeling out both the volatility surface and smile.</p>
<p>I don't believe that my plotting is up to par through Matplotlib, as I think I should be able to make it all far more accurate with more liquid strikes, maturities instead of keeping them consistent across all contracts. Furthermore, I feel as if I should also expand on the way I'm calculating implied volatility as backsolving the equations doesn't seem to capture the forward-looking aspect that I am looking for. I also believe the smoothing/interpolation process that I use when plotting both the smile and surface should be expiremented with more. I would also love to explore using Interactive Broker's Trading Workstation to pull stronger data on the EUR/USD options chain.
</p>
<p>
With all that said, I am happy with the look of the surface I have been able to output. I know it is flawed, though I accomplished what I set out to do. I look to expand on this work in the coming weeks, as well as add stronger context to the write up to expand on what I'm looking to showcase in the plotting of the given surface. As I get more interested in FX Volatility, I look to explore deeper into these topics.
