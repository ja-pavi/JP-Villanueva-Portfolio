      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p class="has-dropcap"> 
        To understand exotic options, you must first have an understanding of basic options, plain vanilla products, such as the American call and put options contracts that are standard on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ. Standard American call and put contracts give buyers the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell a given underlying at a certain strike price within a given set timeframe. I will not go over standard options all to much in this piece, though I believe that <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp"><i>Investopedia</i></a> has a strong overview if you would like to lay the foundation.
      </p>

      <p>
        To build context around exotic options, or simply exotics, it is helpful to define some of the qualities of plain vanilla products. Vanilla products are highly traded and have a set of well defined components on exchanges, while also having frequently updated pricing, implied volatility, and open interest measurements. I say this to emphasize the nuances that surround exotics as over-the-counter (OTC) securities, bringing far more intricacies and abstractions as non standard products over their plain vanilla counterparts. These nonstandard products that are brought to OTC markets are typically created by financial engineers and are constructed in ways to make them far more profitable than the typical options products that are listed on exchanges.
      </p>

      <p> 
        Exotics are nuanced vehicles made for higher profits, with this is mind however, who are they made for and who is making them? 
      </p> 

      <p>
        1. Exotics can be developed to meet hedging needs in the market that a plain vanilla option can't reach such as areas of tax, accounting, legal, or regulatory reasons that make them more attractive to big institutional investors such as corporate treasurers, fund managers, and financial institutions. 
      </p>

      <p>
        2. They can also be developed to fit future market movements surrounding particular variables allowing for nuanced knowledge to be pushed for profitable positions.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Exotics can be developed to allow for a position to appear more attractive to unwary investors than it actually is.
