      <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Some bad news this past week, after taking a strong 3-2 lead against the Rangers, the Astros dropped the ball the next two games to lose the ALCS. Tragic, my predictions were wrong. It was a rough week to experience that, however, with this weekend being Halloween Weekend, it made up for it a little bit (Texans also lost today...). I was able to have a great time with my roommates these past couple of days. Thursday we went to a friend of ours apartment, Friday we had a small gathering at our apartment, and Saturday I went to a concert with friends. It was a great weekend, and I look forward to this upcoming week.
      </p>

      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I'll reiterate a similar sentiment from last week as things haven't really changed. I believe that I don't have anything in my way. I'm feeling good about this upcoming week, and have a lot stronger focus heading into the end of this semester. Time really does fly by, feel like I just moved in to this new apartment. I'm happy, have made tons of great memories, but life is flying currently. For better or for worse, I just am so glad with where I'm at. Wish I could pause things from time to time to take it in better.
      </p>

      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This upcoming week, I'm going to get a haircut.
      </p>

      <h3>What did you think of Paper #10. Why getter and setter methods are evil.</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This week I am finally completing the paper before doing the blog, so I have some thoughts about the paper finally. Like I normally say, I always enjoy reading the papers that are assigned to us, as most of them I find them quite interesting. Being able to annotate and bring some of my own thoughts and connections to the paper allows me to learn better, and allows me to further dive into Computer Science topics. This week, allowed me to really deep dive into a new topic, and appreciate the intricacies and vast arena that software engineering provides. I also love how the author includes the word "evil" in the title, think it ties in nicely with the festive Halloween weekend theme. Excited for next week.
      </p>

      <h3>What did you think of of select, project, cross_join, and theta_join? (This question will vary, week to week.)</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I greatly enjoyed the topics that we covered this past week, and I did okay on the quizzes, some of these quizzes have been getting pretty tricky.
      </p>

      <h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Spending time with people that I have a lot of love for.
      </p>

      <h3>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        My pick-of-the-week has to be the Think or Swim app, it's an interface that makes information gathering for financial markets easier.
